# Naruto Character Guesser
Inspired by the NBA guessing game Poeltl, I wanted to create a similar experience for Naruto fans to enjoy and test how much they really know about the characters in Naruto Shippuden. 

# How To Use
Simply clone this repo, and run npm install in the created directory.

Once that's done, run either npm run OR npm start
